# Systems-Software-Project-4

Creating a systems program that emulates an oven's clock on the PIC18F2580 architecture. The clock will be based off of an internal timer
module and output to a liquid crystal display (LCD). The LCD will have two display modes, one in 12 hour time with AM/PM and a 24 hour mode. The
mode will switch when a push button switch is pressed.
